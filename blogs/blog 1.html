                            <p>
                                We read all the time but we don't even consider the environment that we are in
                                whilst
                                doing it. Our goal is simply to finish the book and not consider opening it
                                again.
                                <br>
                                While reading there are <u>three main requirements</u> we should meet
                                namely, <strong>posture position</strong>,<strong>environmental
                                    adjustments</strong>,</strong> and
                                <strong>speed of reading</strong>.
                                <br>
                            <h3>Posture Positon</h3>

                            We tend to be bored and feel tired even though we've just started reading 15 minutes
                            ago. There is a reason for that and it is posture. You may wonder what it has to do
                            with feeling tired. Let me explain. First, one should find the best spot to read.
                            For example, comfortable and bright enough. After that, sit properly and keep your
                            head upwards. Most people keep their heads down or put the book down on a desk and
                            bend their heads to read. These positions are the cause of feeling tired or even
                            exhausted while studying, reading, etc.
                            To position our heads properly we should lift the book to a point that our neck is
                            straight. This will improve the blood flow through the brain and it will make us
                            more focused.
                            <h3>Environmental Adjustments</h3>
                            After fixing our position we should also consider the <u>light</u> in the room we are in.
                            When
                            the brightness is dim we have a hard time seeing the letters and our eyes become
                            fatigued resulting in inconvenient experiences. Seek glowing light or sunshine to
                            get a
                            better brightness and reading improves instantly. Additionally, the color of the
                            paper
                            has an impact on our eyes and our preferred color would be light yellow.
                            <br><br>

                            <q><em>Somebody who reads a book and doesn't apply it, they're at no advantage over
                                    someone who's illiterate. - Jim Kwik</em></q> <br><br>
                            We covered posture, and brightness of the environment but we need to discuss the key
                            method to comprehend the book. The methods discussed above are critical to reading
                            with
                            satisfaction but not understanding what we are reading will not get us far.

                            <h3>Speed Reading</h3>
                            There is a misconception that, if I read slowly, I will understand the book but
                            sometimes slow reading is the cause of not grasping the information fully due to the
                            lack of focus. When reading slowly our brain tries to think of different things and
                            it
                            will distract us from concentrating on the book. As a result, we don't know what we
                            are
                            reading and we reread the page again and again. This is not an ideal way of reading.
                            <br>
                            A solution would, as you already guessed, be <U>speed reading.</u> Try to read faster than
                            you
                            normally read. You will recognize the way your brain functions by trying to focus
                            more
                            on the book without unexpected thoughts. You will focus more and analyze what you
                            are
                            reading. For the first time, it will be uncomfortable because your brain is not used
                            to
                            reading fast so bear with it and keep practicing to develop the speed reading.

                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            Most people don't read. According to the feedback they give us we can identify that
                            the
                            main cause of it is an unpleasant experience they get while doing reading. They feel
                            tired right off the bat and not comprehending what they just read makes them give up
                            reading. With the help of three simple methods, we can overcome these issues.
                            Methods
                            are, straight neck posture, enough light shine to the book, and finally reading
                            fast/faster than usual. <br> Doing so people will get a chance to fully enjoy the
                            book
                            they
                            were planning to read for months and excitement of reading will emerge through their
                            eyes.
